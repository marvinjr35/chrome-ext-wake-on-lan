# Wake-On-Lan (WOL) Chrome App

Send Wake-On-LAN (WOL) magic packets to other devices on your local network
to wake them up!

Note: This will not work across the internet (because that's how the WOL system
works), and you have to configure your other computer properly first.  Please
search Google for assistance.

This can be installed from the Chrome Web Store:
